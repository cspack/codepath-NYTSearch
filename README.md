# Project 2 - New York Time Search

New York Time Search is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: 14 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
** Detail: Using a fragment.
* [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
  * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
  * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
* [x] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [x] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [x] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [x] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results
* [x] For different news articles that only have text or only have images, use [Heterogenous Layouts](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView
* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [x] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [x] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [x] Uses [retrolambda expressions](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Lambda-Expressions) to cleanup event handling blocks.
* [x] Leverages the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [x] Leverages the [Retrofit networking library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) to access the New York Times API.
* [ ] Replace the embedded `WebView` with [Chrome Custom Tabs](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Chrome-Custom-Tabs) using a custom action button for sharing. (_**2 points**_)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [x] Played with custom font on the search view using Calligraphy library.

## Notes

* The data binding library was not an end-all solution for cases with nested repeated fields in the data object.
* Endless scroll view has a weird race condition if you do a clear and then addAll without calling notifyDataSetChanged.
* GSON can't handle a message in the NY times response properly. (They have, according to the Gson lib, an incorrect field named [] where it have been null.)
* The automatic json model class generator made some fields of type 'object' which aren't usable for parceler libraries, so I needed to replace them with other objects.
